## About

A website designed to help users conveniently order the products they need online. This project demonstrates my knowledge of Laravel as the backend, React as the frontend, and PostgreSQL as the database, as well as how they are integrated into a full-stack application. Users can add or remove products from the cart and update product quantities. User registration and login are required to access these features.
